The North Magnetic Pole's mysterious journey across the Arctic scientists accelerated the update of a model of Earth's fluctuating magnetic field, which is needed to keep navigational systems functioning. Many wondered what happened inside the planet's core. Distinct from the geographic North Pole, where all the lines of longitude meet at the top of the world, the magnetic pole is the point that a compass recognizes as north. At the moment, it is located four degrees south of the geographic North Pole, which lies in the Arctic Ocean at ninety degrees north. But that was not always the case. In the mid-nineteenth century, the North Magnetic Pole floated much further south, roaming around Canada for the past one hundred fifty years. However, the pole has been sprinting away from Canada and towards Siberia. That change of address cannot be ignored, given that magnetic compasses still underpin modern navigation, from the systems used by civilian and military airplanes to those that orient your iPhone.
