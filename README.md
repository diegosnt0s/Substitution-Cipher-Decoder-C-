This project demonstrates a simple **substitution cipher** implemented in C++. I made this for my cyptography class. 
It analyzes the frequency of letters in an encrypted text file and applies a manually created mapping to recover the plaintext.

## Files
- `Ciphertext.txt` → Encrypted input text
- `PlainText.txt` → Original reference text
- `SantosD_a1.cpp` → C++ program to decode ciphertext

## Features
- Counts letter frequencies in the ciphertext
- Displays frequency percentages
- Shows cipher-to-plain mapping
- Outputs both ciphertext and decoded plaintext
- Preserves spaces and punctuation
